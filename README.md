Developing a Microelectronics Value Computer

This project aims to present a simple interface for calculations on the following microelectronic circuit components:
- PN-Junction Diodes
- MOS Capacitors
- MOS Field-Effect Transistors
- Bipolar Junction Transistors

For each component, a clean interface will prompt for necessary information. Once enough information is given to fully define the component, the correct bias range will be determined and desired parameters calculated.
